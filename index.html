                        Hey! My name is Justin and I am a third year student at the University of California at San Diego studying Math-Computer Science. I have a huge interest
                        in data analysis and how it can be used to further understand human behavior as well as its assistance in machine learning 
                        wtth deep learning. In the near future, I hope that I utalize my knowledge to further contribute to the field of artificial intelligence and its uses to leave a positive impact
                        on the world. You can read more about my projects below.
