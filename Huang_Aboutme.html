                        <p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">     Hello my name is Justin Huang, and I am a third year at the University of California at San Diego. Growing up, my life has always revolved and circled around computers. Whatever it would be playing games with my friends, or doing research for school, I would spent most of my day around a computer. This is where my dedication to computer science came in. My familiarity with the computer has allowed a vehement interest for computer engineering to expand and grow. A goal of mine during the past few years was to learn coding for the computer and being able to apply that to my everyday life. In order to achieve, a considerable and abundant amount of time is obligatory to develop the skill of computer science. The same thing is needed to be said for taking engineering classes to help expand the knowledge of programming.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">   Some strengths and commitment that I have that is required to this career is dedication and hard work. All of this is required to succeed, even if it means to try over and over again. As shown in my work inside and outside university, my dedication has has always been centered around my desire to be the best version of myself. Regardless if it is schoolwork or setting new benchmarks in life, I believe that my purpose in life is to leave a positive net impact on the world with my skills and talents.</p>
